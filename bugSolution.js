The issue is addressed by introducing a debounce function. This ensures that `onBarCodeScanned` is only called once after a short delay, even if multiple scans happen in rapid succession.  The debounce function prevents multiple nearly simultaneous barcode scans from being dropped.

```javascript
function debounce(func, wait) {
  let timeout;
  return function executedFunction(...args) {
    const later = () => {
      clearTimeout(timeout);
      func(...args);
    };
    clearTimeout(timeout);
    timeout = setTimeout(later, wait);
  };
}

// ... within your Camera component

<Camera style={cameraStyle} onBarCodeScanned={debounce((barcode) => {
  //Handle barcode scan here
  console.log('Barcode scanned:', barcode);
}, 500)}/>
```
The `debounce` function takes the `onBarCodeScanned` function and a wait time (500 milliseconds) as arguments.  It ensures that only one scan is processed within 500ms, effectively preventing dropped scans due to rapid firing.
